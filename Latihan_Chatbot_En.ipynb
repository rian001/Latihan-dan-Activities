Most notably, the roadster concept features an adaptable wheelbase that can change sizes based on driving modes and a digital cockpit with retractable steering wheel and pedals that are designed to stow away when the car is driving itself. \"This is what we call progressive luxury,\" Henrik Wenders, head of Audi, said during a media event for the vehicle's digital unveiling Tuesday. \"This is not rather a car, it's an experience device.\"\n",
